## Installation

1. You will need to install node.js and mysql. 
2. You will then need to run npm i, in order to get all the necesary packages. 

You will also need to create a .env file to store your mysql login information and the name of the database in order for this program to work.

## Usage

After you have downloaded everything you can go ahead and log into your mysql server in order to set up the database. Run the source command on the schema.sql then the seeds.sql found in the db folder to get the database started and then populate it with some data. Once both of those are completed you can start this app running the server.js file through node. After that you can change, view and add what you'd like.

## Testing

See what works when adding data, if it follows the format intended. Maybe create your own set of data in a different database and test if it works the same on that database set. Run through all the commands and see if they do as they were programmed.
